 Hop is a terminal-based text/code editor.

 usage: hop <valid paths>

 Path Arguments:
  - Each path must point to an existing file or directory.
  - Paths can be relative or absolute.

 Environment Variables:
  - HOP_CONFIG: path to TOML config file, defaults to '~/.config/hop/config.toml'.

 To create a new file, I suggest opening its parent directory
 and creating the file via the context menu of this directory.
